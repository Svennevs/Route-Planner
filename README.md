## Summary
Contains a route planner. It was my submission of the final project for the intro course of the Udacity C++ Nanodegree. Uses OpenStreetMap data and a simple A* search implementation. As heuristic value euclidean distance is used.
The assigment can be found [here](https://github.com/udacity/CppND-Route-Planning-Project)

## Dependencies, building and running
* IO2D is needed, installation instructions be found [here](https://github.com/cpp-io2d/P0267_RefImpl/blob/master/BUILDING.md#cairoxlib-on-linux)
* Create a build directory, build here using cmake
* Run from build using the example map ../bin/Route-Planner -f ../map.osm
